# google-bikeshare-analysis

This project is the capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. This is Case Study 1, which deals with a bike-share company. From the description of the case study:

>You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

The case study gives this information about the company:
  * 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations across Chicago
  * about 30% of users use the bikes to commute to work each day
  * single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships available
  * annual members are much more profitable than casual riders

The company's goal and reason for the analysis: design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

The data for this project is available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
I'm using one year of data from 2022-05 until 2023 - 04.
The total size of this year's worth of data is over 2 gigabytes, so I will do the majority of the analysis in SQL (sqlite running on my personal computer). I will create visualiztions using Tableau, and summarize my findings in a slides presentation.
